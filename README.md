# IsThereAnyDeal Collection Sync Playnite Extension

* [Playnite addon details](https://playnite.link/addons.html#bburky-IsThereAnyDeal)
* [Download extension from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bburky/playnite-playlist/releases)

## Usage

1. Log into IsThereAnyDeal in the "Add-ons..." settings and configure options.
2. Select games to add to your Is There Any Deal collection.
3. Right-click the games and select "Add to IsThereAnyDeal Collection" in the menu.
4. View your collection at https://isthereanydeal.com/collection/import/ or use with https://augmentedsteam.com/ (games on Steam will show if they are already in your collection if owned on another store)

Games are only imported to Is There Any Deal by name, it is possible it could guess the wrong game.

Currently does not handle duplicate copies very well. IsThereAnyDeal offers the choice of ignoring duplicate imports or replacing the all of the old copies with the newly imported copies, you can configure this choice in the extension settings. You cannot merge the new import with the existing IsThereAnyDeal data. If you use the [DuplicateHider extension](https://playnite.link/addons.html#felixkmh_DuplicateHider_Plugin), you can filter your Playnite library to only show the preferred copy and then replace the old copy in IsThereAnyDeal.

This extension does not support importing your list of games from Is There Any Deal *into* Playnite.
